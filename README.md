### Breif

I have been tasked with creating an application that utilises Create, Read, Update and Delete functions in order to demonstrate what I have learned over the last few weeks at the Academy.

### Requirements

In addition to the brief, I am also required to include:

- A jira board with user stories and tasks needed to complete the project.
- A Risk Assessment.
- A relational database used to store data persistently for the project.
- An application created in the OOP language.
- A functioning front-end website and integrated API.
- Unit and Integration testing for the OOP application with a minimum coverage of 80%.
- Code fully integrated into Git.
