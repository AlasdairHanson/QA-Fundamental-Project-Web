I have been tasked with creating an application that utilises Create, Read, Update and Delete functions in order to demonstrate what I have learned over the last few weeks at the Academy.

### Requirements

In addition to the brief, I am also required to include:

- A Jira board with user stories and tasks needed to complete the project.
- A Risk Assessment.
- A relational database used to store data persistently for the project.
- An application created in the OOP language.
- A functioning front-end website and integrated API.
- Unit and Integration testing for the OOP application with a minimum coverage of 80%.
- Code fully integrated into Git.

### My Approach

To achieve the requirements, I have decided to develop a game wishlist application that must allow the user to do the following:

- Add new games to the wish list with the following information:
  * Game title
  * Game price
- View the added games on the web page
- Update a game's title or price
- Delete a game from the wish list

Additionally, I would like the wish list to:

- Display the total cost of all of the existing games in the wish list
- Display the date and time that each game was added
